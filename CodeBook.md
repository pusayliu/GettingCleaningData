The variables of transformed data set are described as below:

The data comes from experiments carried out with 30 volunteers between 19-48 years old. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using the embedded sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) on smartphone, the time domain signals of 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz.

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of the time domain signals and prefix 'f' to those new variables to indicate frequency domain signals. 

In the column names, 'mean' and 'std' indicate measurements of mean and standard deviations repectively, and '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
